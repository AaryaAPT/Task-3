# Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project involves building a simple Linear Regression model using the `scikit-learn` library to predict housing prices. It includes data cleaning, model training, and performance evaluation using standard regression metrics.

## 📁 Files

- `Task 3.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing the complete implementation.
- `housing.csv` — Dataset used for training and testing the model.

## 📊 Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Splitting dataset into training and testing sets
- Training a Linear Regression model
- Evaluating model performance using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared (R²) Score
- Data visualization using matplotlib

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install required libraries:
